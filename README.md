# üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Technical Assignment

Hi, I‚Äôm Karim! This README outlines how I approached and solved the DevOps technical assignment provided by 34ML. This assignment evaluates my skills across various DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipeline setup, bash scripting, Terraform infrastructure provisioning, and NGINX hosting. Below is a comprehensive overview of the tasks and implementations.

## üöÄ Version Control and CI/CD Setup

### Pipeline Stages

**Build üèóÔ∏è**

- **Objective:** Set up the environment and install dependencies.
- **Implementation:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Test üß™**

- **Objective:** Run unit tests to ensure code quality.
- **Implementation:**
    ```bash
    pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
    ```

**Dockerize üê≥**

- **Objective:** Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize the application.
- **Dockerfile:**
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.10-slim

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
    ```
- **docker-compose.yml:**
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      app:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
    ```

**Deploy üöÄ**

- **Objective:** Simulate the deployment process using Docker.
- **Implementation:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Handling

- **Objective:** Handle failures gracefully within the CI pipeline.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Rollback Strategies:** Added scripts to revert to the last successful build.
  - **Alerts:** Integrated with Slack for real-time failure notifications.

## üîÑ Parallelization

- **Objective:** Optimize the pipeline by running tasks in parallel.
- **Implementation:** Configured the CI tool to execute tasks like build and test concurrently to speed up the process.

## üóÉÔ∏è Caching

- **Objective:** Utilize caching to speed up the build process.
- **Implementation:** Enabled caching for dependencies in the CI tool to reduce build times.

## üñ•Ô∏è Bash Scripting

- **Objective:** Create a bash script named `backup.sh` to automate the backup of a MySQL database.
- **Implementation:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Configuration
    DB_USER="username"
    DB_PASSWORD="password"
    DB_NAME="database_name"
    BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup/directory"
    DATE=$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S')

    # Create a backup
    mysqldump -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME > $BACKUP_DIR/db_backup_$DATE.sql

    # Log the backup
    echo "Backup completed on $DATE" >> $BACKUP_DIR/backup_log.txt
    ```

## üåê Terraform

- **Objective:** Use Terraform to define and provision AWS infrastructure for hosting the Flask application.
- **Implementation:**
    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-1"
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "app_instance" {
      ami           = "ami-12345678"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      tags = {
        Name = "FlaskAppInstance"
      }
    }

    resource "aws_db_instance" "db_instance" {
      allocated_storage = 20
      engine            = "mysql"
      instance_class    = "db.t2.micro"
      name              = "flaskappdb"
      username          = "admin"
      password          = "password"
      skip_final_snapshot = true
    }
    ```

## üåç Hosting

- **Objective:** Install and configure NGINX to host the Flask application.
- **Implementation:**
    - **Install NGINX:**
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install nginx
      ```
    - **Configure NGINX:**
      ```nginx
      server {
          listen 80;

          server_name example.com;

          location / {
              proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
              proxy_set_header Host $host;
              proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
              proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
              proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          }
      }
      ```

## üìã Submission Guidelines

- **Code Commit:** Ensure all code is committed to the repository.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and detailed documentation on how to set up and run the project.
- **Deployment Instructions:** Include instructions for deployment and any required configurations.
